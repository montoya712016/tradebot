# realtime_bot_antigo

Legacy realtime bot kept for reference. Superseded by `crypto/realtime_sniper_live.py` and `modules/realtime/*`.

What it contains:
- Older websocket loop and decision logic.
- Simplified dashboard endpoints.
- Examples of how the bot evolved (useful for regression fixes).

Do not run this in production; prefer the new bot. Keep it for code archaeology and comparisons.
